# PASSWORDING
## INTRODUCTION
  *This is a homework for school...NOT FOR FUN
  The program was developed with python3.8.7 only using tkinter
  Using the same phenomenon as Enigma Codes.
## FUNCTION
  - Very very poor user interface
  - Two options: "coding", "decoding"
    coding
    - text box to input your massage
    - press "start" to start coding
    - a pop up window will show the coded message
    
    decoding
    - text box to input your message
    - press "start" to start decoding
    - a pop up window will show the decoded message
## Enigma Machine
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. The Germans believed, erroneously, that use of the Enigma machine enabled them to communicate securely and thus enjoy a huge advantage in World War II. The Enigma machine was considered to be so secure that even the most top–secret[dubious – discuss] messages were enciphered on its electrical circuits.[1]

Enigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded ciphertext. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on a set of machine settings that were generally changed daily during the war, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that were changed for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.

While Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma over the years, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say the flow of Ultra communications intelligence from the decryption of Enigma, Lorenz and other ciphers, shortened the war significantly, and may even have altered its outcome.[2]
